# Arab_Farsi_Image_Classification
Arab and Farsi numeric image classification by way of DeepCognition.ai

I wanted to explore the DeepCongnition.ai (https://deepcognition.ai/) web based ML modelling tools and to compare their "Auto ML" modeling processes to a manual modelling process by way of a Jupyter Notebooks project (https://github.com/BitEconomics/Arab_Farsi_MNIST) This is the result of said project, where the output is a standalone model for classifying Arab / Farsi numbers. 

Usage: \"python3 test.py test.csv
